<p>The ECA framework, (ECA, 2009), developed by the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group, is a partnership between the Global Environment Facility, McKinsey & Company, Swiss Re, the Rockefeller Foundation, ClimateWorks Foundation, the European Commission, and Standard Chartered Bank. The approach evaluates the cost effectiveness of adaptation options, including nature-based solutions and can integrate adaptation and ecosystem management with economic development and sustainable growth. ECA is an open-source methodology that has been applied in various regions around the world (e.g. CCRIF, 2010) and provides a quantitative decision-making framework around two main points:
<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>  The assessment of “climate risk” from (a) the expected annual loss to the location’s economy from existing climate patterns; (b) a projection of the extent to which future economic growth will put greater assets at risk; and finally, (c) an assessment of the incremental loss that could occur in the future under a range of climate change scenarios.<br>
<b>2.</b>  The assessment of cost effectiveness of measures for risk reduction spanning infrastructural, technological, behavioral and financial measures.<br>
