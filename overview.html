The <b>Economics of Coastal Adaptation (ECA)</b> app allows you to explore current and future risks from coastal hazards and to compare the cost-effectiveness of nature-based (green), artificial (gray), and policy solutions to reduce risks and avert damages across the Gulf of Mexico.  In short:
</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>the risks ($) of flooding and wind damage are currently great and will increase over time with economic growth and climate change;</li>
<li>there are several cost effective solutions that taken together could avert tens of billions of dollars in annual damages;</li>
<li>nature-based defenses are some of the most cost effective solutions;</li>
<li>the cost effectiveness of nature-based (green) and artificial (gray) can be compared with one another using open-source, risk-industry based tools. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The app uses open-source methods initially developed by the <a href="http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Economic-Development/ECA_Shaping_Climate_Resilent_Development_Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Economics of Climate Adaptation</a> working group and expanded by Swiss Re in their <a href="https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada" target="_blank">Climada</a> tool, The Nature Conservancy and UC Santa Cruz. The key steps in this approach which you can explore in the different Tabs of the app are:
</p>
<ul class="b">
<li><b>Exposure:</b> to assess the current distribution (or exposure) of assets; </li>
<li><b>Risk:</b> to model risks of flooding and wind damage based on past Gulf storm data and to predict risks in to the future considering both economic growth and climate change; </li>
<li><b>Solutions:</b> to compare the cost effectiveness of large scale solutions for averting future damages. </li>
</ul>
