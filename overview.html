<p>The <b>Economics of Coastal Adaptation (ECA)</b> app allows you to explore current and future risks from coastal hazards and to compare the cost-effectiveness of nature-based (green), artificial (gray), and policy solutions to reduce risks and avert damages across the Gulf of Mexico.  In short:
<ul class="a">
<li>the risks ($) of flooding and wind damage are currently great and will increase over time with economic growth and climate change;</li>
<li>there are several cost effective solutions that taken together could avert tens of billions of dollars in annual damages;</li>
<li>nature-based defenses are some of the most cost effective solutions;</li>
<li>the cost effectiveness of nature-based (green) and artificial (gray) can be compared with one another using open-source, risk-industry based tools. </li>
</ul>
The app uses open-source methods initially developed by the <a href="http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Economic-Development/ECA_Shaping_Climate_Resilent_Development_Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Economics of Climate Adaptation</a> working group and expanded by Swiss Re in their <a href="https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada" target="_blank">Climada</a> tool, The Nature Conservancy and UC Santa Cruz. The key steps in this approach which you can explore in the differnt Tabs of the app are:
<ul class="b">
<li><b>Exposure:</b> to assess the current distribution (or exposure) of assets; </li>
<li><b>Risk:</b> to model risks of flooding and wind damage based on past Gulf storm data and to predict risks in to the future considering both economic growth and climate change; </li>
<li><b>Solutions:</b> to compare the cost effectiveness of large scale solutions for averting future damages. </li>
</ul>

=======
<p>The ECA framework, (ECA, 2009), developed by the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group, is a partnership between the Global Environment Facility, McKinsey & Company, Swiss Re, the Rockefeller Foundation, ClimateWorks Foundation, the European Commission, and Standard Chartered Bank. The approach evaluates the cost effectiveness of adaptation options, including nature-based solutions and can integrate adaptation and ecosystem management with economic development and sustainable growth. ECA is an open-source methodology that has been applied in various regions around the world (e.g. CCRIF, 2010) and provides a quantitative decision-making framework around two main points:
<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>  The assessment of “climate risk” from (a) the expected annual loss to the location’s economy from existing climate patterns; (b) a projection of the extent to which future economic growth will put greater assets at risk; and finally, (c) an assessment of the incremental loss that could occur in the future under a range of climate change scenarios.<br>
<b>2.</b>  The assessment of cost effectiveness of measures for risk reduction spanning infrastructural, technological, behavioral and financial measures.<br>

<span class="overviewHeader"><b>Main objectives of the app</b></span></br>
Show and facilitate the use of the information on risks (present and future) and cost-effectiveness of risk reduction measures throughout the Gulf </p>
<p>
<span class="overviewHeader"><b>Using the app</b></span></br>
Use the following tabs to sequentially step through calculating the risk and benefits of adaptation and risk reduction: Exposure distribution; Damages estimation (Risk); and Solutions to reduce Risk.</p>
